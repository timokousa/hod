   HLS On Demand


ABOUT

 A set of scripts and a segmenter to generate HLS from various sources when
 requested. Complete with transcoding, AES encryption and simple authentication.

 Transcoding is started on the first m3u8 request. Live transcoding is stopped
 after a brief inactivity. Non-live transcodings are kept on disk until disk
 free space goes below defined limit.

 I use this to stream VDR channels and recordings to my Android phone.


REQUIREMENTS

 PHP for the scripts.
 FFmpeg for transcoding.
 OpenSSL for AES encryption.


INSTALL

 cd tools
 make
 make install

 Optionally copy the transcoding config file to /etc and edit as needed.

 Put the files in htdocs to appropriate place for webapps and make sure the
 data dir is writable by the daemon running the php. Edit rc.php, auth.php,
 sources.php and vdr*.php as needed.
